# Week_9 Challenge

## Overview

W. Avy wants to open up a surf shop on the island of Oahu. However, he needs help analyzing the weahter of this island. He wants to look into the temperatures during the months of June and December. This is important data for his business to be successful. If the weather is too cold, customers will not want to surf or get ice cream.

 - <b>December:</b> The average temperate in Oahu during the month of December is 71 degree fahrenheit.
 This is cooler than June; however, it is winter. This temperature will bring tourists to Oahu to escape the cold winter months of their home regions.
